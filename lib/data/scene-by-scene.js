'\'Fire Walk With Me\', I haven\'t seen that for a while. Beautiful. No I don\'t. To do you a great favour. You bet. I\'ve done a few interviews concerning it, yes. She has taught people English. Right, you know there\'s many different languages, and one of them is film, or painting, and a lot of it is done without words. A film is its own thing.  And in an ideal world, I think film should be discovered knowing nothing, and nothing should be added to it, and nothing should be subtracted from it. I believe it is, yes.  Not that slow, but probably 48 frames or something. That\'s a little slower too. It\'s a mood - you slow things down for a feeling, and those things are abstract reasons. It\'s a dreamy feeling and it could slide, you know, either way.  The  next things that follow say more and more what it is. I sure do!  I haven\'t seen that for about, you know, 100 years... There you go man... You don\'t know where things come from, they can come from memories, or they can be triggered, they can just come to you from the ether; and if they are in the memory, if they\'re stored away - one day, for some reason, they\'re released, and it seems like a brand new idea.  Or, an idea comes in from the ether, and as it pops, it may be coloured from something that you know.  The picture that forms, sometimes reading a book the pictures that you put together, from the past or your imagination kicks in, you can\'t really tell what forms those pictures, it\'s the words on the page, and probably many internal things. Yes it is.  Mary Sweeney first read about Alvin Straight in the New York Times, and the trip he took. And she developed a fixation, for four years, until she got the rights to the story.  And then, she and her childhood friend, John Roach wrote the script and handed it over to me. Not really, the words `based on a true story\' give you, you know, room to move.  And when you  make a film, you\'re making a different kind  of reality anyway. It feels correct. Well, you want to get the lay of the land, and you\'re observing. And now you\'re floating. You want to enter in, you know, seeing things and float, slowly into  the story. It\'s a small neighbourhood in the town of Laurens, Iowa.  It\'s a very small town.  There\'s just one main street.  And there\'s several smaller streets off of it, but it\'s very small. I would prefer a little bigger town.  Or no town. You\'d have to wait and find out. OK. Yeah, he\'s slipped and fallen... There\'s only one Alvin Straight. But, there\'s similar qualities, yeah. That\'s one of the things, yeah.  Well it\'s a cowboy, the old west,  there\'s an inner strength coupled  with innocence and a tender side, that Alvin has - Alvin is a lot like a  cowboy. Well, the smoke is not a solid thing, but on film, it almost appears to be solid, and I think the smoke, ties in, you know, with organic growth, and the elephant man, the neurofibromatosis growths, always reminded me of Mount St. Helena, a smoke, frozen, the flesh became like a smoke, and it erupted, you know from inside the bones, and protruded out, and became, you know, the smoke frozen. 15 days. Well, it wasn\'t for me.  I was going to go to school in Salzburg, Austria, and study with a painter called Kukashka and, he wasn\'t there when I arrived, and I very quickly realised that Salzburg was too clean. But I was studying painting, and I felt it was too clean to paint. So, I went searching, still in Europe, and each place didn\'t feel correct, and back I went. Oh, sure.  Life is made up of many experiences, and if you allow them  to, they\'ll teach you things. Well, you see, there\'s a unity among people, and there\'s something about in `It\'s a Wonderful Life,\' you know, he stayed in town, he wanted to go, but he stayed in town. He still had a full life, the human experience is true one place, it\'s true another place, you don\'t have to travel around to get a lot of experience. There\'s something about the way the world is, you can almost kind of  tap into feelings outside your environment. No, it\'s the small and the infinite, sort of hand in hand.  And the stars are there for everybody, and they make you dream, and Alvin Straight shared the stars with someone, and it\'s a beautiful memory for him. Yes. I\'m going to tell you a story about that. It was just one of those beautiful things, after which Freddie started calling me Lucky Lynch. Freddie Francis, right.  The camera was just, you know, drifting in very slowly on Tony Hopkins\' face and exactly as it stops, a tear comes out of Tony Hopkins\' eye.  And he told me later that he\'d been saying the Lord\'s Prayer you konw during that scene, and it moved him, and out came the tear, and it was one take and we were, you konw done; Well, Philadelphia was a city filled with fear. Filled with twisted behaviour, it\'s called the city of brotherly love - the absence of brotherly love was alive and well.  There was sort of a sickness in the air, a twisted, infectious, sickness in a decaying city, but it was very  powerful, and a lot of Philadelphia seeped into me, and it was a time of  life when the window was wide open, and things hit you particularly hard, and it was a beautiful experience for me. Well, it fed many things that came along later. Well, I think there\'s a mixture of things always in life. And, in order to have one, you have to have the other.  In order to appreciate ups, you have to have the downs. And so films are made up of contrasts that are felt more than seen, so there\'s the feelings of things in the air and sometimes those things can take on a persona. Right, I was on the set in Laura Palmer\'s house, we were going to shoot a panning shot in Laura\'s room to start with, and Frank da Silva was a set decorator and he was in arranging some furniture, and at a certain point he moved a chest of drawers in front of the door. And someone behind me, as I was pointing in the other direction, said `Don\'t block yourself in there, Frank,\' and my mind pictured Frank blocked in the room.  And then, I rushed in to him and said, `Frank, are you an actor?\' and he said, `Why, I happen to be an actor,\' so I said, `You are going to be in this\' and so we did a couple of pans without Frank, and then I had him kneel down behind the bed and freeze, and we panned around and there he was.  Hard to kind of see right away, but if you held it for while, suddenly you sort of see him.  And I didn\'t have a clue what I was going to do with that, and then later we were shooting the last setup in the house, and it was pretty late at night, and it was Mrs. Palmer, at the end of the day where she lost her daughter, smoking a cigarette, distraught on the couch, and playing some scenes in her mind.  And she sees something mentally, and lurches up.  And the operator has to crank, you know, very fast to catch it, nailed it perfect, she screams at the top of this thing in a big closeup and I said `Beautiful,\' and I congratulated Grace on her job and Sean, the operator, said, `No, it\'s not good, not good, not good,\' and I said, `What\'s wrong?\' And he says, `Someone was reflected in the mirror,\' and I said `Who was reflected in the mirror?\' and he said, `Frank was.\'  And then I knew I was onto something. A very big sign. And it led to many things, that those two events kept unravelling. Absolutely... A lot of things that happen are maybe food for thought, but it ends up being useless, but some of those things are such great gifts you can\'t imagine... Well I have, I don\'t like wind on my collarbone and that\'s how that all started. And that\'s a sign of a person who\'s very insecure and needs protection.  I would have worn several coats, if I, you know, it wasn\'t so warm where I was.  I just, I felt vulnerable. Well, they feel good. I was - I don\'t know why I was.  I had things that I wanted to do, but I didn\'t like being in the world so much.  Out in the world. I liked being inside. I have a hair of that. It comes about - well, I\'m not sure how it comes about. But, there\'s many things to deal with outside the house.  Bad things can happen, and why bother with that, why not stay inside, and do your work? I don\'t see him as me - I see him as Geoffrey Beaumont. And, there\'s some similarities, but it\'s the idea of just a bit of innocence. Yes, that\'s a fantasy.  That goes together with many other things and a story comes out, and it\'s the opening of another world for Geoffrey. No. No... There might have been a - that didn\'t even look too wide a lens, really. Well, we don\'t know - that\'s the thing about the film, it starts, and then it ends, and nothing should be added and nothing should be taken away.  So it\'s wrong for me to say, but it\'s beautiful for, you know, anyone has the right to, you know, go where they wanna go. No. No, they\'ll back me up. There is no best scene. No, it\'s like music - every note is important , and, to the whole - every element that you do is important and so then the thing can hang together.  If you take anything out and just look at it without the rest, it\'s not the same.  Film is a sequence of events and the way they\'re ordered is critical. No.  While you\'re working, you don\'t leave until it feels correct to you, because you\'re the spectator, and the one that\'s trying to stay true to the story, so if it feels correct, then you move on. Well, that scene seems a little irrelevant, and yet, I don\'t know why, but always I felt that scene was critical.  It has its own pace and it has a lot to do with the idea of drinking and why, you know, we drink and it has to do with being near an end, and wanting to prolong something. This guy is great, this bartender.  Just his face, and the way he moves. M-hm. Yeah, a Zen bartender. Well, you know, nature can teach us a lot of things, and there\'s something about, in painting, you\'re working within a certain shaped canvas and there\'s many things that you, you know, one does intuitively, to move the eye, you konw, there\'s repetition of shape, there\'s repetition of colour, but when you start looking at a duck, you see your eye is moving in a certain way, and you see textures and colours and shapes and you start wondering about a duck, what it can teach us about, you know, any kind of abstract, you know, painting, or proportions or even sequences, scenes, and it always is interesting that the eye is in the perfect place - if you move it to the body, it would get lost, if you move to the leg or the beak, it\'s two, kind of, fast areas competing, even though the eye is the fastest, it\'s the little jewel. Well, there\'s slow and fast.  An empty room is a certain speed, and a person standing there is another speed, and that proportion is, you know, can be beautiful, if the room is a 2 and the person is a 7. I think a person is around a 7; fire and electricity can go up to a 9, for instance, or really intricately designed, you know, decorative room is pretty disturbing, sometimes - it\'s too fast.  But then if you put something slow in it, it could work beautifully.  A busy room and a person, they fight each other.  So... It\'s a relationship thing, I think.  Fast and slow areas. I haven\'t thought about it.  I have to think about it.  I can\'t just jump in and think, but I believe every film has the eye of the duck scene.  But, it can fool you.  You know, which one it is - it could be the scene we were talking about, I don\'t know. I used to know. It\'s the eye of the duck, that\'s the eye of the duck, yes, yes. I used to know.   No, I think, strangely, the eye of the duck scene is the ending. It\'s organic, I\'m not against the computer, or digital, and I love manipulating images, but film still has, the beautiful organic quality.  And a lot of times, with light and the emulsion and the way it\'s developed you get some happy accidents, you get something that\'s thrilling to the soul. I think, right now, digital\'s coming up every year, but it hasn\'t matched, you know, the beauty of film. It\'s the same thing, plus, there might have been way to work by, you know, pouring over to digital, and then coming back to film, but it would have been way too expensive for us. Because, you know, it\'s so beautiful to discover ways, you know, of doing things, and it\'s a beautiful medium, because it allows so many things to happen. `Dune\' was a failure to me, because I didn\'t feel I did, you know, the `Dune\' I should have done.  This was not a failure to me, because I felt it was a film that I did the way I should have done it.  And so we learn that we can\'t control anything that happens after a film is finished, and sometimes things go well in the world, and sometimes they don\'t. But if you believe in the film, and you\'ve done your best, they can\'t take that away from you.  There\'s this thing - there\'s the doughnut, and there\'s the hole, and we should keep our eye on the doughnut and not on the hole.  Everything that happens after a film is finished is maybe interesting and it can be, you know, very hurtful, or exhilerating in certain ways, but it has not much to do with the work.  And so I would like to go back to work as quickly as I can or do, you know, painting or work on music.  And be separate, you know, from those things I can\'t control. Well, the problem is that somebody sees a woman in a film, and then mistakenly assumes that that is the way the person sees all women, when in actuality it\'s just that particular woman within this particular story.  It means nothing more than that, although it could have, you know, repurcussions, a small story can open up, you know, a bigger feeling, but it doesn\'t mean Alvin Straight represents all 73 year olds and more than Dorothy Valens represents all women, or whatever she was talking about. No - things can go away, and then they can come back again too. There are?  I don\'t remember them all. Oh yeah. Yeah. Have I seen them?  No.  There are many things I think that are out there that we don\'t know about, but sometimes, you know, you get certain feelings about. No. No.  I feel strangely, and I think probably other directors feel, somewhat alone, and you make friends, but, so much of the thing is internal. Well, I\'m not a political person. Oh no, I\'m not cynical at all. I\'m just saying that I don\'t understand politics, I don\'t understand the concept of two sides, and I think that probably there\'s good on both sides, bad on both sides, and there\'s a middle ground, but it nevers seems to come to the middle ground.  And, it\'s very frustrating watching it, and seemingly we\'re not going forward.  Some change of simple, simple, really relatively speaking, and we\'re going forward somewhere, you know, it could be a beautiful place.  There\'s many little obstacles and there\'s many people that are just opposed, and we\'re not moving forward. I have no idea what Ronald Reagan would say. I think there\'s a time in you to go out and gather things and they say that when you\'re little, the window is open, and then the window closes, not all the way, but closes for safety reasons, so stuff stops coming in and you can work with, you know, things that are there.  And new things can pop in and join with them, but now it\'s a time, you know, to start doing some things with the things you\'ve gathered... Inside, we\'re ageless.  And when we talk to ourselves, it\'s the same person we were talking to, the same age, when we were little, and it\'s the body that\'s changing around that ageless centre. That\'s not the self that you\'re talking to, that\'s the amount of information that you have. And information and experience, knowledge and experience, is part of the, /is/ the process, and so the more knowledge you have, coupled with experience, you konw, the more you go, but the self you talk to, that I was talking about, that\'s the one that\'s sort of ageless.  It doesn\'t mean ignorant it just means it doesn\'t have an age. Um.  Yes. Well, they say many things remain, it\'s just the body that\'s dropped.  Good place to end. Um. Not one bit. Good to talk to you. What critic said that? No. Oh, that\'s OK then. I want to see this book. This book even smells - yeah, it\'s a beautiful smell.';
