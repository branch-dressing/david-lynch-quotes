module.exports = 'Thank you very much. I’m very honoured to be here. It’s great to be with you tonight. …I found it on the map. I found it very nice, great place. Incredible, incredibly sturdy buildings. Yes. The ’50s – what a beautiful time. The birth of rock and roll in the ’50s changed music so much and it was such a thrill. In the ’50s, where I was, there was an optimism in the air, a feeling of a bright and shiny future. There were cars that were very, very beautiful with lots of chrome and it was a beautiful time to dream. Oh no, I wasn’t a troubled child; I had a beautiful childhood. I always say we’re like detectives. We sense things, and as you look around you sense that maybe things are not so bright and shiny and you get little winds of trouble. Well, when I was little I would draw all the time. Because it was right after the war, I would draw mainly guns, rifles and knives, and really enjoyed that drawing. My mother, for some reason, refused to give me colouring books, which was a real blessing. No, no. My father would bring paper home from the office and I would draw on that. I got into painting and never thought it was something an adult did seriously. It was so much fun and so thrilling but I thought it would come to an end. Then I met my friend Toby Keeler, on the front lawn of my girlfriend’s house, not knowing that soon he was going to be stealing my girlfriend from me. But it didn’t matter because Toby told me that his father was a painter. At first I thought a housepainter and then I realised that he was a fine artist and it totally, completely changed my life. From that moment on I was 14 or 15, I wanted to be a painter. No problem She was a very nice girl. The smoke stack industry... unbelievable. Smoke and fire, big machines, great sounds. It’s fantastic visually and for sound. It’s just beautiful. I know it’s terrible, but good for the environment of course. In the old days factories were literally like cathedrals. Now they’re non-descript, small. Maybe they’re dealing with even more power but it’s not visually good and sound-wise, pathetic. Well, you know, cinema can create another world. That’s what’s so beautiful about it. So, even though out in this world things are one way, we can get ideas and make a world to go into and have experiences, so all those things can come to life. I saw Eraserhead last with my then 14-yearold son. I don’t answer them really. But he really liked it. Believe it or not, Eraserhead is my most spiritual film. No, I won’t. No, no. It’s so beautiful that the only problem is running out of money. But the sets were there all during that time. I always say I was so fortunate that Jack Nance’s hair stayed good during those five years. It was so good to be in that world. It was shot on an 18 acre estate, a 55-room mansion on the hill but I had the entire stables. I had a hay loft, maids quarters, I had a camera room, editing room, food room, rooms for sets, garages, stalls. I had a mini studio for over four years. It was incredible. The American Film Institute. Yes. There is one scene, at least one, where Henry is on one side of the door, turns the knob, there’s a cut and a year and a half later he enters his room. I was involved with them before. I was studying painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. I was in a studio one day, working on a painting of a garden at night. I was looking at this painting and from the painting came a wind. The green starting moving and I said ‘Oh... A moving painting’. I did a thing for the experimental painting and sculpture contest of a stop-motion painting on a sculptured screen that went continuously with the sound of a siren and that was going to be the end of it. But a gentleman saw this, and commissioned a similar thing for his home. In doing that, I purchased a new camera, which I didn’t realise was broken. Two months later, I get the 100ft piece of film back and it was a total blur. But it was not a depressing feeling. It was an optimism soaring out of that. Because I talked to them and what had happened but said I had an idea for another thing called The Alphabet. It was animation and live action. Then I wrote a script called The Grandmother. I heard about the American Film Institute, if you submit previous work and a script that you want to make, maybe you could get a grant. I got an independent filmmaker’s grant from the American Film Institute and was able to make The Grandmother. On the strength of that I got accepted to the Centre of Advanced Film Studies in LA. Yes. It didn’t ever take off. I always say it came out at the time when the midnight circuit was very popular. Had it not been for the midnight circuit, Eraserhead would have been long gone. But a guy named Ben Barenholz, who they called the grandfather of midnight films, saw it in New York, loved it and he distributed it. He said: “David, I’m going to spend no money, no advertising and there’ll be lines around the block within two months.” And it was sort of true. It played in some theatres for three or four years. Even though it only played one night in the theatre, it was always on the marquee. So word kind of went around. Oh, it was a big, big thrill. Well, afterwards. Incredible. Fate handed me Mel Brooks. He saw Eraserhead and I thought this would be the end to everything. But he came out of the theatre racing towards me, arms out, embraced me and said “You’re a mad man. I love you.” Yes, a very tight hug. Mel Brooks backed me up 100% on that film and it worked out really well. I won’t tell you that story. There you have John Hurt who literally became, in his morning make-up, transformed into John Merrick – just beyond the most beautiful performance. Tony Hopkins was rock solid and Sir John Gielgud – what a great human being he was. The day I was going to work with Sir John, I was putting on my underwear and thinking ‘Here I am, putting on my underwear and I’m going off to work with Sir John Gielgud’. You know, a thing is built with elements. You just try to get every element to feel correct as you march along, based on the idea. I had a script I wrote after Eraserhead called Ronnie Rocket. Stuart called me out of the blue one day, raving about Eraserhead, and was trying to help me get Ronnie Rocket going. No-one wanted to know so, after trying for a long time, I called and said “Stuart, I think I should try to direct something that exists. Do you know of any scripts that I could direct?” Stuart said: “David, I know four scripts that you could direct. Come to lunch with me at Nibblers and I’ll tell you about them.” So we met up at Nibblers, sat down and before we even ordered anything I said: “Stuart, now tell me.” He said: “Well, the first one is a film called The Elephant Man,” and an explosion went off in my head. I never heard the other three. It wasn’t easy. This film was turned down by six studios. Everybody said: ‘Nobody wants to see a film about a monster like this.’ Somehow, Stuart got this to Anne Bancroft. Anne Bancroft got it to Mel and Mel made it happen. I was born in Missoula, Montana and here I am in London doing a Victorian drama – pretty strange. When I first met Wendy Hiller , she grabbed me by my neck (she’s short) and lifted me about a foot in the air, marched me around the room and said: “I don’t know you. I’ll be watching you.” She became one of my biggest supporters when things got tough. Christopher Tucker saved the day. It was a bad time, four very dark days when I thought I wouldn’t make it. In sleep, the nightmares were so horrible, but waking up was worse and I wished I could go back to those nightmares. Mel Brooks flew over from LA and I thought he was gonna send me packing. Meanwhile, Jonathan Sanger the producer had gotten hold of Chris Tucker. All Mel said was “Thank God for Chris Tucker. David, you shouldn’t have been worried about that. You gotta direct the film.” So again, Mel Brooks like a saint relieved all this horror. It’s a long story Jason but I thought I could make it happen. Sure… People think that a woman in a film represents all women. This kind of thinking leads to those kind of things but it’s just her, her particular character in this particular world. Those things happened to her. It’s like in the ‘50s, the optimistic shiny exterior and then a lot of darkness swimming beneath it. These sorts of things go on, no matter what time it is. For sure. The beginning of the ideas for the film came out of Bobby Vinton’s version of Blue Velvet. So Isabella Rossellini is required to sing this song. She started on her own with a voice coach but they learnt the 1952 version which, you know, was a big mistake. We tried to correct this in the studio. It wasn’t working so Fred Caruso, the producer, said: “Let me bring my buddy Angelo down and he can work with Isabella.” Angelo came down, played the piano and worked with Isabella. They recorded a thing – it was incredibly beautiful. Angelo played it to me the first time I met him, in the driveway of the Beaumont house in Lumberton and I said: “Angelo, this is so beautiful we can cut it into the picture right now.” Then we were trying to get another song. It was costing a lot and there were legal problems, whether we could get it or not. Yes it was. So Fred said “You’re always writing things, why don’t you send Angelo some stuff and see if he can write something that feels as good?” I said: “Fred, there’s 20 million songs I want ‘Song To The Siren’.” But Angelo wrote the song ‘Mysteries Of Love’ and it did go in. Then I said “Angelo, you gotta score the picture” and that’s how we started working together. The rule for me is to get the thing to marry with the picture. I think it’s intuited, it’s not an intellectual thing. You may love many, many songs but they’re not necessarily going to marry. A lot of times, it’s a big experimentation to find the thing that marries – how the thing enters, how it grows, how it moves and how it exits. You get it to feel correct. For you, based on the idea. No it wasn’t, it was the second I think, maybe the third. He was on the list of actors for sure but the reputation of Dennis had fallen and you couldn’t work with him. So one day his manager calls and says: “David, you know Dennis is clean and sober. He made another picture and you can talk to the director and he can tell you how great it was working with Dennis. Also, Dennis really wants to talk to you.” So the next phone call was Dennis Hopper and he says: “David, I have to play Frank Booth because I am Frank Booth.” So it was good news and bad news combined. But Dennis is the perfect, perfect person and it was so beautiful that he did that. What’s an imperial phase? I catch ideas and translate them to a medium. I don’t know. I think Twin Peaks caught so much of the world. Laura Dern as Lula is really incredible. Well, I worked with her in Blue Velvet and then she became a friend. When you know somebody more you see different sides of them and you see that they can do different things… so when it came to Wild At Heart, I knew she could do it. Lula’s got this kind of goodness in her and so does Sailor. I always say it’s a modern romance because Sailor really respects Lula and Lula really respects Sailor. They are equals going down the road. It’s a real nice relationship. For sure. It’s based on Barry Gifford’s book. The book is written very minimally but it sprouted so many seeds in my head and so the script is different than the book. There was something going on in the world then, and it had just gotten worse and worse but it seemed like things were coming apart. This was 1989, so I forget what it was but there was a feeling in the air that things were starting to get pretty crazy. There’s humour. There is a lot of absurdity in life but films do reflect the world in which we live. Ideas come from our world. As the world changes, ideas change, cinema changes. Thirties cinema has a certain feel, it says ‘that time’. Sixties cinema – a whole different feel, ‘cause the world changes, cinema changes. No... and no one could really live with that. Barry was cool with this happy ending. Great, great actor. Fearless and so much fun to work with. Get an idea, run it by Nic and he can make it happen. A really great time. I loved the idea of a continuing story, so that seemed intriguing. I always thought of it as a film – we shot on film, we worked the same way as film. This world was so fantastic to go into, such great characters. I could see it going on and that was the thrill. The commercials and interruptions are, you know, a very bad thing. Fortuitous? Huge. She was supposed to just play a dead girl. When interviewing her I said: “I would like to dip you in grey dye. Do you have a problem with that?” ‘Who killed Laura Palmer?’ – the mystery of that was what drove everything. When we had to solve that mystery, that’s what killed everything. What, the solving of it? No, the solving isn’t fine. It could still be going. It is going, maybe, mentally, but it’s not going on television. It’s a little bit of both. You’re happy and surprised at how it travelled. But at the same time there’s a huge, huge, amount of work to keep it going and I wanted to get on to Wild At Heart in the middle of all of this. It’s a tough thing. No, this is another world that we can go into. I see it just like cinema. We had a tremendous amount of freedom. There was some dialogue censorship but it was unbelievable freedom... right up until we had to solve the murder. Yes. You’ve got to have freedom. Why would you do something if you didn’t have freedom? It’s a horror. It’s a nightmare. I just felt that this whole thing of Laura Palmer, her side of the story, the last seven days of Laura Palmer, thrilled me. You’ve go to do what you believe in and you never know what audiences are gonna think. There wasn’t a lot of the humour from Twin Peaks, it was a dark story. But I love this film. I didn’t die a death when it didn’t do well. I was very happy. You go up and you go down. Everybody probably knows that success is just as dangerous as failure, maybe more. You second guess yourself from then on because you’re afraid to fall. Failure? Terrible at first but then, oh man, total freedom. There is nowhere to go but up, and it’s a very good thing. Oh, many, many things. No, no, no. The film is the thing. You work so hard after ideas come to get this thing built, and all the elements to feel correct, in this beautiful language we call cinema. The second it’s finished, people want you to change it back into words and it’s very saddening... it’s a torture. When things are concrete,very few variations and interpretations. The more abstract a thing gets, the more varied the interpretations. But people still know inside what it is for them. You come up with many, many different things as you go along as a detective. It’s a ghost story for you.  psychology as such. This film Mulholland Drive invites that sort of reading doesn’t it? Sure. When I finished Blue Velvet, I think it was a friend of Isabella Rossellin’s, a psychoanalyst, who got together periodically with a group of 16 psychoanalysts and they would write-up things on film. They took on Blue Velvet and sent me the pages. It was pretty interesting. No, I don’t really remember. Again, it’s the world we get to go into. You feel and you think and you come to these conclusions for yourself and you don’t need the director to say anything. You have everything in the film. That’s the thing, it doesn’t matter what I say, zip. It can only be a negative. The thing is built so you don’t want to take anything away and you don’t want to add anything to it, it’s complete, that’s it. I get ideas that I fall in love with. I fall in love with them because of the idea and the way cinema can translate that idea. You get painting ideas, chair ideas, photography ideas, music ideas, such a beautiful thing to get an idea. Then you see it, you hear it, there it is. And then you just translate it and you build it. A lot of the times I get an idea, I don’t know what that idea means. So I think about it and find a meaning for me. Another idea comes and hooks to it, the script starts going and building. Then you build that thing until it feels correct, based on those ideas that have been driving the boat. Then you get it to feel correct and it’s done. I understand but it’s just not right to say something because you could hurt it. No. I got an idea for a scene and I thought it was a one-off scene. I had this Sony PD150 camera. I wrote the scene out and shot it. Then I got another idea. I thought it was a one-off thing so I shot it. It didn’t relate to the first thing at all. Then I got another idea and it didn’t relate to the first two. I shot that. Then I got some ideas that related those. This happens in writing a script but here it was already shot with a Sony PD150, so I continued with the Sony PD150 and then more ideas came and I shot in a more traditional way. But I’d always have the script before we went out and shot anything. No, it was locked down scene by scene but the end was not known for some time. No, I don’t ever feel like I’m making something up. You’re getting ideas. It’s like getting fish. You don’t make the fish. It swims in, you catch it, and then you can cook it bad, medium or good. The little fish swim in as ideas and you catch them, you see them and this fish is so beautiful and you love this little fish. It’s just a fragment of something but you love it and you write down the idea. It’s like a bait that will bring in more, and they’ll marry to that and a story just starts coming up. What, fish? Yes, probably. I know what you mean when you say that. I’m not doing it for any reason except for falling in love with the ideas. The Straight Story is linear and I say that is my most abstract film. I read the script, which I did not write, but a script is like getting organised ideas. When you read the words, the thing comes alive in your head. It was the emotion that I felt in that script. I said: ‘How do you get this emotion with so few elements in an 09 10 absolute straight, linear line?’ So it was an experiment to get this sound and music and words and look so that it’s a thing. We all see people crying or doing something on screen but the crying doesn’t come to the audience. They’re crying but you’re not crying. You’re not feeling it. To get the feeling, there is a trick. It’s an experiment, finding that way. Let’s say Marilyn Monroe steps in next to you Jason. Would it be a reluctant embrace, for you to embrace her? No reluctance. Forty minute takes, light weight, automatic focus, smaller crews. It’s a dream for scenes. Sound has been digital for years, picture is going digital. It’s not any kind of new lease. It’s just a better way to go. No two prints of film are the same. It breaks, it gets dirty, it burns, it gets water marks, hairs and the equipment is so heavy, giant equipment. Some of it was shot in Poland. Sometimes you visit a place and get ideas from that place, and this is what happened visiting Łódz´. I went to the CameraImage Film Festival. The guys that run the festival, now my good friends, came to visit me way back when in 2000, I think, to talk to me about coming to the festival. I said: “If I go, would you help me get into factories to photograph and would you get me nude women at night to photograph?” and they did that. The city of Łódz´ has this mood in the winter and ideas came. If they are speaking a foreign language other than English, there’s supposed to be subtitles. If there’s not, there’s a big problem here in England. It’s the flow of them. The loud and the soft of them and a little bit of a pause. Those things plus the meaning. No. No. It maybe is abstract and I certainly know what you’re talking about but what do you mean by ‘strange’? It’s a human being story. No. Thank you, Jason, very much.';
