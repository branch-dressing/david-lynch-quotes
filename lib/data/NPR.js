module.exports = 'Good to be here. Well, I don\'t know. It just came up. It was Kristine\'s idea, and she does these interviews with lots and lots of different people that were part of my life. And I read what they say, and I basically tell them they remembered it wrong, and I tell them how it really was. I was at a party put on by an agent named Swifty Lazar at Spago restaurant here in L.A., and he threw a party - Oscar party - every year. So I\'m there. I had been nominated for "Blue Velvet," and I came in, said hello to, you know, John Huston. And then Elizabeth Taylor looks at me and she said, I love "Blue Velvet." And I said, well, I wish I had won tonight because Oliver Stone had won. And I said, you gave the award - the Best Director award - and Oliver Stone got to kiss you. And she moved her finger, beckoning me to come to her. So I went around, and she tilted her head back and closed those violet eyes, and I started sinking down, closer and closer and closer, till my lips touched hers. She has these pillow lips - a deep, deep, deep, most fantastic kiss of Elizabeth Taylor. It was a different kind of feeling in the air. It was like a feeling of optimism. I always say it just was sort of represented by this fantastic chrome on the cars and birth of rock ’n’ roll. And look at some of the interiors of homes while you\'re listening to that music and see how people dressed and see these faces, it would start coming to you, a feeling of that time. I always say the women in my films don\'t represent all women. They represent that particular character, that woman, and these things are happening to that woman. It\'s part of the story. And a lot of ideas come conjured by the world we live in. So it\'s that particular woman, and it doesn\'t represent all women. It doesn\'t come from my dreams. I never hardly ever have gotten any ideas from dreams or my obsessions sort of. It\'s ideas that I fall in love with. You know, you would fall in love with different ideas. But when you get one that you\'re in love with, you\'re set, you\'re rocking, and you\'re ready to go. And you know exactly what to do. Exactly right. And with this technique, people see things like stress going, anxieties, tensions sadness, depression, hate, rage, need for revenge and fear start to automatically lift away. The artist doesn\'t have to suffer to show suffering. You can be very, very happy showing suffering on the screen or writing suffering in a book, but you don\'t have to suffer to do that. And you can be very happy. And that\'s so important for people to understand. You should understand the suffering, understand the human condition, but you don\'t have to suffer to show suffering. thanks a lot.';
